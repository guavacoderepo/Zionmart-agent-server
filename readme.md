# 🧠 AI-Powered Support & Product Retrieval System  

This project is an **AI-integrated support and product management system** built to streamline how users interact with an e-commerce or business support environment. It leverages **LangChain tools**, **SQLAlchemy ORM**, and **modular AI agents** to automate product retrieval, customer support ticketing, and user management tasks.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

The system acts as a **bridge between AI reasoning and real-world database operations**. By integrating LangChain’s `@tool` framework with SQLAlchemy, the project allows AI agents to:  
- Search for products by name or description.  
- Create, edit, or delete customer support tickets.  
- Retrieve user information dynamically from the database.  

This setup allows **conversational AI systems** (like chatbots or agentic applications) to **directly perform structured database actions**, improving automation, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

The project is organized into distinct modules that handle different functional areas:  

### 1. **Product Retrieval Tool**
Allows AI agents to retrieve product details by name, even when the user provides partial or fuzzy input.  
- Performs **case-insensitive searches**.  
- Returns structured product information (ID, name, price, and description).  
- Handles empty or invalid search queries gracefully.  

### 2. **Ticket Management Tools**
Automates customer support workflows through four main actions:  
- **Create Ticket:** Records a new customer inquiry, linked to a user and optional department.  
- **Edit Ticket:** Updates ticket details such as message, subject, department, or status.  
- **Delete Ticket:** Removes tickets that are resolved or no longer needed.  
- **Retrieve Ticket:** (Optional future addition) Could allow for detailed query or filtering of support tickets.  

Each ticket tool ensures **transactional safety** with rollback mechanisms to maintain database integrity.  

### 3. **User Management Tools**
Provides AI-driven access to user information.  
- Retrieve user by **ID** (UUID-based).  
- Retrieve user(s) by **name or email**, allowing for flexible lookup during chat-based queries.  
- Returns lightweight user information (ID, name, email) for safe agentic use.

## 🧠 AI & Agentic Capabilities  

The project is designed to be **agent-compatible**, meaning it can be embedded inside a LangChain agent or similar LLM workflow.  

For example, a chatbot can:  
- Understand “Find me shoes under £50” → trigger `retrieve_product_by_name()`.  
- Handle “Open a support ticket for my order delay” → trigger `create_ticket()`.  
- Process “Update my ticket to closed” → trigger `edit_ticket()`.  

This provides **human-like automation** while keeping actions safe and structured through controlled database access.

## ⚙️ Key Features  

✅ **AI Tooling Integration:** Each function is wrapped as a LangChain `@tool`, making it discoverable by LLM agents.  
✅ **Database Safety:** Each transaction includes rollback protection and session management.  
✅ **Scalability:** Can easily integrate new models or tools (e.g., order tracking, product recommendation).  
✅ **Human-Readable Returns:** Outputs are returned as dictionaries and lists for easy parsing in chat or API environments.  
✅ **Extensible Structure:** Supports additional tables or AI tools without major refactoring.

## 🧪 Use Cases  

### 🛍️ **E-commerce Chatbots**
Integrate with AI assistants to help users find products, check availability, and generate support tickets.  

### 🧑‍💻 **Support Desks**
Automate ticket management for helpdesk systems, reducing workload and improving response times.  

### 🧩 **Agentic Systems**
Embed into larger AI frameworks to enable data-grounded reasoning — allowing LLMs to interact with structured data directly.  

---

## 🔒 Error Handling & Validation  

Each tool uses:  
- **Try/Except blocks** to catch runtime errors.  
- **Graceful fallbacks** that return descriptive error messages instead of crashing.  
- **Database session cleanup** with `finally: session.close()` to prevent memory leaks.  

---

## 🌐 Future Enhancements  

- ✅ Add **order management tools** (track, update, cancel).  
- ✅ Introduce **multi-agent collaboration** between support, sales, and analytics agents.  
- ✅ Include **vector search** for product recommendations using embeddings.  
- ✅ Add **authentication & access control** for secure API calls.

## 🧭 Conclusion  

This project is a foundation for **AI-driven operational systems**, bridging natural language reasoning with real business actions.  
It can be deployed as a standalone backend or integrated into **LangChain, OpenAI Assistants, or agentic orchestration frameworks** to build intelligent, context-aware automation.
